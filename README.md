"#SingletonSample"
This is a sample implementation of Singleton.
Plan to take care of reinitialization and/or return of stale values of the Singleton by 
1. Reflection
2. Serialization
3. Multi-threading

Study article http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/singleton-1577166.html


I have also added a Parallel implementation of a Singleton in Kotlin.

Please do comment/fork/email if have any suggestions or advice
